My solutions for problems sent from [Daily Coding Probloem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/). Don't count on them being corrct.

I've been getting these problems every day since 25th November 2018. There are a few early ones where I will have saved the solutions on a forgotten hard drive somewhere long ago, but it's safe to assume the files here are for any I've attmepted since around the start of 2020. As you can see from the small number of files in this repo, I very rarely actually do them.
